## Personal
I had a lot of fun going to the wedding with Reina. It was interesting witnessing a “normal” life; a suburban life that I have yet to experience in my own family. One of stability, or at least on the surface one of stability. It reminded me a lot of my Aunt Satpaul’s family life.

I definitely am missing seeing my family. I’d like to see them soon.

I live a unique life. The day after the wedding I left for Berlin for a business conference called ICBC.

## Professional
I’m a bit nervous heading to ICBC. I feel a little unprepared but I’ll figure it out. I’ve got some time before the conference to sit down and go through attendees and reach out to people.
