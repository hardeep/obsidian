* I walked away from yesterday's meeting feeling pretty exhausted and confused.
* There were two things that I wanted to walk away with
	* I have two people who have experience in creating physical product companies. Can they provide some mentorship around our thinking.
		* What insights can they provide around our understanding of the problem.
		* We've had some headwinds in the market with landing more of the market. We've been trying to answer:
			* Is it a product problem
			* Is it a way that we're trying to sell into the market
			* Is it a market awareness problem?
	* How are they thinking about fundraising. Is it an option, how will they contribute, when will they contribute (what metrics need to be hit)
