After yesterday’s board meeting, I left feeling somewhat exhausted and unclear. There were two key outcomes I had hoped to walk away with:

First, we have two board members with deep experience in building physical product companies, and I was hoping for more structured mentorship from them. Specifically, I’d like their perspective on how we’re framing the problem we’re solving and what might be contributing to the challenges we're facing in gaining more market traction. We're trying to understand whether it’s a product issue, a go-to-market execution issue, or a market awareness gap.

Second, I had hoped for more clarity around fundraising—whether it’s something we should be actively pursuing, how the board is thinking about it, and what metrics or signals they’d need to see in order to contribute or support that process meaningfully.
