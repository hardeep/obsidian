When a company is trying to cross the chasm—that is, transition from early adopters to the early majority in the technology adoption lifecycle—the board of directors can be a critical strategic asset.
### 1. **Market Insight and Focus**

- **Refining target segment**: Board members often bring experience and industry insight that helps narrow the target segment within the early majority.
- **Customer persona validation**: They challenge assumptions and push for clarity on who the "beachhead" customer is.
### 2. **Go-to-Market Guidance**

- **Sales and marketing oversight**: The board ensures the company shifts to a repeatable, scalable GTM process.
- **Pricing, packaging, and positioning**: They pressure-test these elements to align with expectations of mainstream buyers.

### 3. **Operational Scaling**

- **Hiring leadership**: They often assist in recruiting key hires, especially in sales, marketing, and customer success.
- **Building infrastructure**: They support investments in customer support, onboarding, and training—crucial for the early majority.

### 4. **Financial Stewardship**

- **Funding readiness**: Crossing the chasm can require significant capital to build infrastructure and bridge slower sales cycles.
- **Metrics focus**: Boards help define and monitor KPIs like CAC, LTV, and churn to ensure progress is measurable and sustainable.
