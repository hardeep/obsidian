Gravity is what holds a planet together — and what draws others toward it.

It has mass — substance, consistency, and pull.

Great companies are the same.

They have gravity because of what they’ve built — the quality of their product, the clarity of their story, the depth of their culture.

## The Layers of Company Gravity

| Type of Gravity  | What It Means                                                 | Examples                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Product Gravity  | People are drawn to use and stay because it feels right.      | Apple, Tesla, Dyson                         |
| Brand Gravity    | People identify with what it represents.                      | Nike, Patagonia, LEGO                       |
| Cultural Gravity | Talent wants to work there; alumni carry the ethos with them. | Pixar, SpaceX, IDEO                         |
| Network Gravity  | The ecosystem makes it hard to leave.                         | Microsoft, Shopify, Amazon                  |
| Purpose Gravity  | A mission that aligns hearts and action.                      | Patagonia, OpenAI, Elevation-style founders |

|        |                                                                                                                                                                                       |                        |

| Stage  | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Typical Annual Revenue |
| Gather | The early pull of gravity â€” a few strong forces drawing things together. Founder-led operations, scrappy wins, and reactive fulfillment. The goal is to find traction and momentum. | $0 - $1M               |
| Join   | Pieces begin to hold together â€” a small team forms, simple systems take shape, and the business starts to produce consistent results.                                               | $1M â€“ $5M            |
| Shape  | The world finds its center. Roles are defined, delivery becomes reliable, and leadership starts to emerge. The organization gains structure and rhythm.                               | $5M â€“ $20M           |
| Settle | The environment stabilizes. Departments develop, scale builds across products or markets, and leaders shift from day-to-day operations to strategy.                                   | $20M â€“ $75M          |
| Thrive | A mature world â€” high-performing, balanced, and self-sustaining. The company operates at scale with strong systems, accountability, and enduring culture.                           | $75M â€“ $200M+        |
