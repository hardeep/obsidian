The creative act. A way of being


Albrecht Thaer

Albrecht Thaer was a pioneering German agronomist who significantly advanced agricultural science. He initially practiced as a physician before shifting his focus to agriculture, where he became renowned for his experimental approach to farming. Thaer founded one of the first agricultural schools in Germany, promoting scientific methods in agriculture and developing the humus theory of plant nutrition. His seminal work, “Principles of Agriculture,” laid the foundation for modern agricultural practices and education. Thaer’s influence extended across Europe, shaping agricultural development well into the future.

The humus theory, developed by Albrecht Thaer, posited that humus, the organic component of soil, is the primary source of nutrients for plants. According to this theory, the decomposition of humus was believed to be directly responsible for providing necessary nutrients to crops. This view influenced agricultural practices and soil management strategies during Thaer's time, though it was later replaced by the mineral theory of plant nutrition, which emphasizes that plants absorb nutrients in the form of ions from the soil.
