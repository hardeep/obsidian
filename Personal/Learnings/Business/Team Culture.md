## Values


## Cultural Competencies

**Cultural Competencies** are the _specific, observable patterns of behaviour_ that demonstrate how individuals embody a company’s culture in practice.

They sit between **values** (the company’s guiding principles) and **performance** (the results someone delivers). While values are abstract and performance is outcome-based, cultural competencies are **behaviour-based** — they describe _how people approach their work, interact with others, and make decisions_ in ways that reinforce or undermine the desired culture.

In the abstract sense:

- They are **context-agnostic** (relevant across roles and functions).
- They are **timeless** (should matter today, tomorrow, and at scale).
- They are **binary-observable** (you can point to whether someone did or didn’t demonstrate them, without relying on feelings).
### 1. Urgency

Approaches work with a strong bias for action, moving quickly to deliver, test, and learn — ensuring speed doesn’t come at the cost of quality.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They take the first step quickly instead of waiting for perfect information.
- They prefer testing in reality over debating in theory.
- They escalate or unblock themselves when things stall.
- They set momentum that pushes others forward.
- They deliver faster without creating unnecessary complexity.

**When not demonstrated (No):**
- They delay decisions waiting for certainty or consensus.
- They over-analyze instead of acting.
- They let blockers sit instead of escalating or solving them.
- They consistently move slower than the urgency of the situation requires.
- They slow the team with steps that don’t add value.

### 2. Customer Orientation

Approaches decisions through the lens of the customer’s jobs-to-be-done — ensuring their needs are understood and framed in a way that also supports scale, speed, and quality.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They uncover the _underlying job_ behind a request, not just the surface ask.
- They explain trade-offs clearly when a request conflicts with strategy.
- They offer alternatives that reduce friction for the customer while aligning with company goals.
- They frame internal conversations in terms of customer outcomes.
- They show customers they’ve been heard, even when the answer is “no.”

**When not demonstrated (No):**
- They treat every customer request as an order to be followed.
- They dismiss or ignore customer concerns without addressing the underlying job.
- They optimize only for internal processes at the customer’s expense.
- They say “no” without explaining it in terms of customer outcomes.
- They build solutions for one-off customers that increase complexity for everyone.
---
### 3. Innovation Mindset

Approaches recurring problems as opportunities to design simpler, faster, higher-quality ways of working, testing ideas in practice rather than theory.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They spot patterns in recurring problems and look for root causes.
- They propose small, concrete improvements that cut waste.
- They test ideas quickly in real work, not just in planning.
- They turn friction points into improvements others can adopt.
- They measure whether changes improve speed or quality.

**When not demonstrated (No):**

- They accept inefficiencies as “just the way it is.”
- They repeat the same fixes without reflection.
- They propose ideas that add complexity instead of reducing it.
- They avoid experimenting because they fear mistakes.
- They focus on theory or brainstorming without testing in reality.
---
### 4. Systems Thinking

Approaches problems by looking beyond the immediate issue, connecting causes and effects, and considering ripple effects — with the goal of reducing complexity and increasing speed and quality.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They step back and ask “What’s really causing this?” before fixing symptoms.
- They connect today’s issue to patterns they’ve seen before.
- They consider how their decision affects other teams, customers, or future work.
- They make trade-offs visible (e.g., “This fix helps now but may slow X later”).
- They simplify the system while improving speed or quality, not just their own process.

**When not demonstrated (No):**
- They react only to what’s directly in front of them.
- They treat each issue as isolated and new, even when recurring.
- They optimize their own task or team in ways that create bottlenecks.
- They add steps or controls that slow down delivery instead of solving upstream.
- They rarely ask “why” more than once.
---
### 5. Technical Mastery

Approaches their craft by striving for deep expertise and the highest standards — pushing themselves and others toward excellence in delivery and innovation.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They pursue mastery in their area, not just “good enough.”
- They keep up with new methods, tools, and best practices.
- They deliver work that holds up under pressure and scrutiny.
- They mentor others, raising the technical bar across the team.
- They refuse shortcuts that create long-term quality risks.

**When not demonstrated (No):**
- They settle for “good enough” when quality matters.
- They stop learning once they’re comfortable.
- They rely on others to cover gaps in their expertise.
- They avoid feedback or resist peer review.
- Their work introduces technical debt that slows delivery later.
---
### 6. Adaptability (Plain-Language, Approach-Based)

Approaches change with openness and flexibility, adjusting quickly to new realities in ways that simplify work and improve delivery speed and quality.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They adjust their approach when conditions shift.
- They adopt new tools or practices that improve outcomes.
- They reflect on mistakes and change behavior next time.
- They stay calm and constructive during change or uncertainty.
- They share lessons with others to help the team adapt.

**When not demonstrated (No):**
- They resist change, clinging to old methods even when they add friction.
- They repeat the same mistakes without learning.
- They delay adopting improvements that would help.
- They react with frustration or negativity to new directions.
- They keep lessons private instead of sharing.
---
### 7. Trust (Plain-Language, Approach-Based)

Approaches teamwork with candor and respect, creating an environment where issues surface early and people can act quickly and confidently.

**When demonstrated (Yes):**
- They admit mistakes openly and quickly.
- They ask questions without fear of judgment.
- They challenge assumptions respectfully.
- They listen to and include different perspectives.
- They support others who raise concerns or ideas.

**When not demonstrated (No):**
- They hide mistakes until they escalate.
- They discourage questions or curiosity.
- They shut down dissent or opposing views.
- They withhold feedback out of fear or politics.
- They create tension or fear that slows others down.

## Cultural Competencies On the 9-Box (0–7)
- **0–2 = Never**  
    Rarely demonstrates cultural competencies; clear misfit.
- **3–5 = Some of the Time**  
    Inconsistent; mixes Yes and No behaviours, not reliable under pressure.
- **6–7 = All of the Time**  
    Consistently demonstrates cultural competencies as their natural way of working; reliable culture fit.
### Why these bands work
- **0–2:** Too few to be workable in a startup. If someone demonstrates <3 out of 7 cultural behaviors, they’ll constantly create friction.
- **3–5:** They show flashes, but not enough consistency to be trusted with scale. This is the danger zone where people can look “okay” but drag the org over time.
- **6–7:** This is the bar — culture is only strong if it’s lived all the time.
### Example
- Candidate A: Scores 6 (all but Technical Mastery). → **All of the Time**
- Candidate B: Scores 4 (Urgency, Customer Orientation, Trust, but fails on Systems Thinking, Adaptability, Innovation). → **Some of the Time**
- Candidate C: Scores 1 (only Trust). → **Never**
### Startup Application
- Only hire or keep **6–7s**.
- Move quickly on **3–5s** if they don’t level up almost immediately.
- Exit **0–2s** fast — wrong hire.
